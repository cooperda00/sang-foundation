      <h2>Sang means light in Sanskrit and in Thai</h2>
      <p>
        In the quest for a cleaner and greener globe and a crystal clear ocean,
        'Sang' is literally translated as 'light' in Thai, and will continue to
        ignite the creation of love and care for our beloved mother earth for
        the generations to come.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Sang Foundation was created to raise public awareness that plastic
        waste is now at a critical level and more and more marine animals are
        painfully dying because of our addiction to plastic. We are here to
        spread the message that this does not need to happen - there are
        alternatives to plastic.
