                Mutsumi is the founder of the Sang Foundation, which she founded
                after operating the holistic center Omroom in Bangkok.
              </p>
              <p>
                Mutsumi realized that healing an individual cannot adequately
                shift the paradigm. Humans cannot be happy if other beings are
                suffering from an imbalance in the natural world and ongoing
                climate destruction.
              </p>
              <p>
                Only by doing the ground work of helping people and animals as
                well as educating the young generation on how to live in harmony
                with Mother Earth, will we find key to our problems.

              I have been trying to live a lifestyle using fewer plastics with
              great success, practicing the 5Râ€™s: Refuse, Rethink, Reduce,
              Recycle, and Repurpose in my everyday life for the past two years.
              I added the 6th R (rot) in August 2018; yes, composting fruit and
              vegetable scraps to reduce waste and provide free organic
              fertilizer for my garden.
            </p>
            <p>
              My journey was not an easy task but with strong commitment,
              consistency, concern, consciousness, and cause, I did it. Share
              your thoughts of environmental awareness lifestyles with family
              and friends and it will become a domino effect. The results are
              exponential. Take action now, join us living life use less
              plastic.

              Missy is an American mom of an 8 year old boy, and having a
              passion for the oceans and animals she was shocked at the extreme
              and offensive overuse of plastics in this country and went looking
              to find groups to join to fight it. And quickly found Mutsumi and
              Sang Foundation.
